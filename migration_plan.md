## Cluster Migration Plan for Legacy Kubernetes Clusters

### Objective
To ensure a smooth and efficient migration of legacy Kubernetes clusters to a new environment with minimal downtime and maximum data integrity.

---

### Key Assumptions
1. The target cluster is set up and configured with the latest Kubernetes version.
2. Adequate resources are provisioned in the target environment to accommodate workloads from the legacy clusters.
3. CI/CD pipelines and automation tools are in place for managing the migration process.
4. Backups of all critical data are taken prior to migration.

---

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Assessment
1. **Inventory Assessment**
   - Identify all workloads (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, etc.) in the legacy cluster.
   - List all namespaces, configurations, secrets, and persistent volume claims (PVCs).
   - Document current resource utilization and dependencies.

2. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Map dependencies between services, databases, and external systems.
   - Identify third-party integrations (e.g., monitoring, logging, and service meshes).

3. **Compatibility Check**
   - Verify compatibility of existing workloads with the Kubernetes version of the target cluster.
   - Check deprecated APIs and update configurations if needed.

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks (e.g., downtime, data loss, configuration mismatches) and mitigation strategies.

#### Phase 2: Environment Preparation
1. **Target Cluster Setup**
   - Provision the target Kubernetes cluster with appropriate resource allocation.
   - Configure network policies, RBAC rules, and namespaces.

2. **Testing Environment**
   - Create a staging environment to replicate the production setup for testing the migration.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Update**
   - Update deployment pipelines to point to the target cluster.
   - Automate infrastructure provisioning using tools like Helm, Terraform, or ArgoCD.

#### Phase 3: Data Backup and Sync
1. **Data Backup**
   - Backup all critical data from PVCs, databases, and other storage systems.
   - Validate the integrity of the backups.

2. **Database Synchronization**
   - Set up database replication or export/import to ensure data consistency.
   - Perform an initial sync to the target environment.

3. **Container Image Registry**
   - Ensure container images are available in the target clusterâ€™s image registry.

#### Phase 4: Migration Execution
1. **Dry Run in Staging**
   - Deploy workloads in the staging environment.
   - Validate application behavior, configurations, and performance.

2. **Namespace-by-Namespace Migration**
   - Migrate workloads incrementally, starting with less critical namespaces.
   - Use tools like `kubectl`, `velero`, or `kube-migrator` for migration.
   - Verify that services in the target cluster function as expected.

3. **Service Cutover**
   - Point DNS, load balancers, and ingress controllers to the target cluster.
   - Monitor application traffic and performance post-cutover.

#### Phase 5: Post-Migration Validation
1. **Validation Checks**
   - Verify all workloads, configurations, and services are operational.
   - Check resource utilization and scaling behavior.

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging systems.
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics and anomalies.

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Perform functional and integration testing to ensure complete system functionality.

#### Phase 6: Decommissioning Legacy Cluster
1. **Data Archival**
   - Archive logs, configurations, and backups from the legacy cluster.

2. **Cluster Shutdown**
   - Gradually scale down workloads and services in the legacy cluster.
   - Decommission unused resources to optimize costs.

---

### Success Criteria
1. Workloads are fully operational in the target cluster with no major incidents.
2. Data integrity is verified, and all services function as expected.
3. Monitoring and alerting systems are active and capturing metrics from the target cluster.
4. The legacy cluster is safely decommissioned after a successful migration.

---

### Tools and Technologies
1. **Migration Tools**: Velero, Kube-migrator, Helm
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Fluentd
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible
4. **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD

---

### Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 5-6**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Notes
- Ensure continuous communication with stakeholders throughout the migration process.
- Schedule migrations during low-traffic periods to minimize disruption.
- Prepare a rollback plan in case of critical issues during the migration.
